# Constructor-Hangman


## This is hangman command-line game using constructor functions.

## You will be guessing a randomly selected word from a vegetable array.

## You start with 10 tries.

## Every unsuccessfull try reduces the count by one.

## Letters that you have already guessed are displayed for you.

## If you pick a letter that you have already tried it shows that and it doesn't count towards your unsuccessful guesses.

## The game ends either by you guessing all the letters right or running out of guesses.
